      'If you are experiencing violence, it may be helpful to reach out to family, friends and neighbours, to seek support from a hotline or, if safe, from online service for survivors of violence. Make a safety plan in case the violence against you or your children escalates. This includes: Identifying a neighbor, friend, relative, colleague, or shelter to go to in case you need to leave the house immediately for safety; Have a plan for how you will exit the house safely and how you will reach there (e.g. transport); Keep a few essential items (e.g. identification documents, phone, money, medicines, and clothes) available, and a list of telephone numbers in case of an emergency; If possible, develop a code with a trusted neighbour so they can come to your aid in case of an emergency. r\n',

    content: `Violence against women is highly prevalent, and intimate partner violence is the most common form of violence. Whilst data are scarce, reports from across the world, including China, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and other countries suggest a significant increase in domestic violence cases related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Reports from other countries suggest a reduction in survivors seeking services due to a combination of lockdown measures and not wanting to attend health services for fear of infection.\r\n`,

    title: 'How does COVID-19 increase the risk of violence for women?',
    content: `Stress, the disruption of social and protective networks, loss of income and decreased access to services all can exacerbate the risk of violence for women. In many countries, where people are encouraged or required to stay at home, the risk of intimate partner violence is likely to increase. In addition, access to sexual and reproductive health services will likely become more limited. Other services, such as hotlines, crisis centers, shelters, legal aid, and protection services, may also be reduced, making it difficult for women to access the few sources of help that would usually be available.\r\n`,

I know it can be uncomfortable to do and we do feel inhibited, but when these men don’t think twice about staring us down in public, why should we when it comes to calling them out for their harassment? You will be surprised at how effective the simple act of calling someone is. Always keep your safety in mind when you do so, and call them out in a safe, public space. Never do it when you are alone .\r\n`,
